# Chess masters

**This is a simple chess game, inspires by [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/).**

## Notes
- Currently in dev, can be run locally though.
- Running over websocket only, need to make it fault tolerent as server is statefull right now.
- Mobile view needs some work, made it responsive enough to not overflow at least.
